1,userrl1mw2fp2f,언니 첨 볼 때부터 여쿨이라고 생각했는데 근데 지금 머리부터 메이크업까지 다 통일하고 피부가 하얘서 그런지 웜한 스타일링도 잘어울려요ㅋㅋㅋ,10.0,9개월 전
2,AllMyInkHybrid,"I agree ! Getting rid of negative influence from other people, helps you getting stronger. I was in a friendship with a girl who was only negative about everything: when I was happy, she wanted me to be sad. When I was sad, I wasn’t allowed to be sad. I was never good enough. Keep a distance from toxic people ️
I am happy you are doing well! And good luck with your english ",10.0,9개월 전
