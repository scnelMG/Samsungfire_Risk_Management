23,princessraj5921,"I love her hair . I can so relate, I have long hair like her and live in China people here are always asking me if it is hard to care for.  But I have very fine hair so I barely notice it.  I have had it bra strap length waist length hip length now bottom of my butt and don't really notice a difference except I feel more beautiful with it long and healthy my husband loves it.  Washing it and combing it takes like 10-15 minutes I use a good conditioning balm and only wash it 2-3 times a week then I just blow dry it for a few minutes and just clip it up and let it air dry it takes me under a min. to put it in a braid or bun.  my bun can be small no matter the length my hair is fine I used a bun volumizer donut thing til it reached my butt haha. So hair texture makes a huge difference I have found plus I don't want heat damage so I only straighten it or curl it for special events once in a while and I go to the salon for that.  They do this gorgeous braided headband on me in China and curl the ends it is my favorite fancy hairstyle .  I actually find shorter hairstyles much more difficult because with fine hair it takes a lot to style them and it is hard to just clip them up.  In fourth grade I tried an inverted bob I begged my mom for and omg if my parents didnt blow dry it for me every morning I wouldnt leave the house my fine hair would stick out like crazy.

However, I can tell that her hair is really damaged starting from the halfway point down the rest of the length and she needs to get it cut. If she changes her mind and wants to keep growing it, she's going to need to get those dead ends chopped off first and start applying a leave-in conditioner, hair oil, or both on the ends after she finishes washing and to try to break the habit of sleeping on a towel with wet hair since the hair is more fragile when wet and combining it with the friction from the towel can cause hair breakage over time.

그게 다른게 아니라 제가 희망사항이랍시고 1. 튼튼한 비녀, 2. 접이식 대부채, 3. 불후의 명곡 트로트 옛명곡 모음과 김용임 선생님의 타령및 민요모음곡들로… 어떻게 보면 참 뜬금없는 것들을 부탁했었거든요. 이은관 선생님의 배뱅이굿과 회음곡 등등은 아쉽게도 당시 찾기도 힘들어 포기를 했었는데 그게 지금 문득 생각이 나며 다시 한번 아쉬움을 느낀다고 하면 웃으시려나… 


암튼 당시 저의 머리도 장난이 아니었던게 완전 풀어 제치면 무릎 바로 아래의 길이로 평상시엔 긴 머리를 일단 땋은 뒤 쪽을 지고 생활했으면 취침신 그냥 잘 빗어 헝클어진 곳들을 대충 정리하곤 땋은 머리를 한 채로 잠이 들곤 했었죠. 그러다가 어느날 갑자기 눈 딱 감고 어깨에 닿을까 말까의 길이로 집에서 확 잘라 버렸었더랬죠. ㅋ 그 후 저는 오히려 남들이 더 아깝다고 난리를 피우며 도대체 왜 머리를 잘랐냐고 자꾸 귀찮게 물어보는 바람에 빡치는 마음에 그참에 그냥 홀라당 다 밀어버리려고 했더니 이번에는 제 남편과 아이들 셋이 다 한마음으로 결사반대를 하는 통에 결국은 대충 짧막한 머리로 몇년을 대충 보냈는데, 어찌저찌하다보니 머리는 다시 어느새 허리 밑을 훌쩍 넘기는 길이 되어 이번엔 미장원에 가서 좀더 파격적으로 팍 짤라 버린 모습에 자기 머리와 별반 길이에 차이가 없다며 남편이 어이가 없다는 듯 고개를 절레절레 흔들었던 게 생각이 나네요. ㅋ

어쨌든 요즘에 와서는 그때처럼은 아니더라도 정수리가 횡한게 티가 안날 정도로 적당하게 숱많은 머리이면 무조건 좋겠다는 생각을 하다가도 문득문득 또 확 과감하게 삭발을 하고 싶은 충동이 드는 걸 애써 눌러가며 살아간답니다. ㅋ
