9,glorygloryholeallelujah,"(Ps) I use these type of beautiful dichroic foils in my resin work—and if you don’t want to fold it, or if you want a more “abstract” design on your foil… 
I like to take the straight edge tool that is on the other end of most cuticle pushing tools and I put the foil on a foam sheet (or makeup sponge) then I gently press a design into the foil before I use it (the design possibilities are endless!). 

I recommend practicing with a little scrap piece of foil, to find the right amount of pressure to use (so you don’t accidentally cut into the foil while drawing your lovely design!)

I hope this tip/idea possibly helps inspire someone to play with the method and make something beautiful!
